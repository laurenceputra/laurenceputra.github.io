# Homepage Content Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the complete content structure for Laurence Putra Franslay's redesigned homepage. The content follows a 5-section structure emphasizing Singapore humility culture, team credits, and mission-first narratives.

## File Location

- **Primary content file**: `/content/_index_new.md`
- **Current file** (to be replaced): `/content/_index.md`

## Content Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Singapore Humility Culture**: "Jiak ba bo tai ji zuo" (eat full nothing to do) positioning
2. **Team Credits**: Extensive acknowledgment of collaborators in every project
3. **Mission-First**: Why before what, community before individual
4. **Parallel Paths**: Tech and social work running together, not sequentially
5. **"We" Over "I"**: Collective achievement framing

### What to Avoid

- ❌ American personal branding / Silicon Valley self-promotion
- ❌ "Tech savior" narrative
- ❌ Solo hero positioning
- ❌ Awards showcase without context
- ❌ Jargon without explanation (e.g., "risk capital" needs context)

## Section Structure

### 1. Hero Section

**Purpose**: First impression with humble positioning

**Content Elements**:
- Name: "Laurence Putra Franslay"
- Tagline: "Building communities, supporting people"
- Profile image with accessible alt text
- Current roles WITH context (not bare titles)

**Images**:
- **Primary**: `/img/profile/profile-2021-full-body.jpg`
- **Alt text**: "Laurence Putra Franslay at an award ceremony, wearing formal attire"
- **Purpose**: Professional but approachable first impression

**Tone**: Humble yet clear. NOT "Engineering Leader × Philanthropist" (too bold)

- Subheading: "When we care together, we can achieve more together"

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Singapore Humility Patterns

**Use**:
- "We" language ("what we built together")
- Team credits in every project mention
- Humble deflection ("ordinary Singaporeans")
- Context before credentials
- "Jiak ba bo tai ji zuo" self-deprecation
- "With privilege comes responsibility"

**Avoid**:
- "I achieved" framing
- Solo accomplishment language
- Awards as standalone showcase
- Tech credentials without service context
- Jargon without explanation

### Sentence Structure Examples

✅ GOOD: "Project Stable Staples is the story of how 8 ordinary Singaporeans came together, supported by 73 volunteers who made deliveries happen."

❌ AVOID: "I founded Project Stable Staples and raised over SGD 160k to help families."

✅ GOOD: "The People of Good Award recognized the 73 volunteers who showed up every week, not any individual organizer."

❌ AVOID: "I received the People of Good Award for my work with Project Stable Staples."

✅ GOOD: "At TikTok, I work with talented teams building distributed systems that serve millions."

❌ AVOID: "At TikTok, I lead critical infrastructure serving millions of users globally."

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Review Content**: Read through `_index_new.md` and verify tone/accuracy
2. **Update Template**: Modify `/themes/laurenceputra/layouts/index.html` to consume YAML data
3. **Test Rendering**: Run `hugo server` and verify all sections render correctly
4. **Validate Images**: Ensure all image paths work and alt text displays
5. **Replace File**: Once validated, replace `/content/_index.md` with `_index_new.md`
6. **Build & Deploy**: Run `hugo build` and deploy to production

---

## Maintenance Notes

When updating content in the future:

1. **Always include team credits** when mentioning projects
2. **Frame awards in context** of collective work
3. **Use "we" language** over "I" language
4. **Explain jargon** (e.g., "patient capital" needs context)
5. **Show parallel paths** in journey (tech + social together)
6. **Lead with mission** (why) before accomplishments (what)

The content structure is designed to be extensible—new projects, awards, or initiatives can be added following the existing patterns while maintaining Singapore humility culture.
