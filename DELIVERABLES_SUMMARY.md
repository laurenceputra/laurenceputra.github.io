## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Singapore Humility Culture
- "Ordinary Singaporeans doing good" framing throughout
- "Jiak ba bo tai ji zuo" philosophy integrated
- Humble deflection of individual achievement
- "Don't need to talk big, just do" spirit

### ✅ Extensive Team Credits
Every single project mention includes:
- Specific volunteer counts
- Collaborator acknowledgment
- Public trust recognition
- Family/colleague support mentioned

Examples:
- PSS: "8 founders + 73 volunteers + hundreds of donors + family support + PayPal colleagues"
- IAT: "Dozens of volunteer facilitators + industry professionals + educators"
- GeekcampSG: "Organizing committee + speakers + sponsors + attendees"

### ✅ Mission-First Framing
All sections lead with WHY (mission) before WHAT (accomplishments):
- LYHKYLF: Purpose explained before credentials
- TikTok: Team environment emphasized before technical scope
- PSS: Community need identified before fundraising numbers

### ✅ Parallel Paths Emphasis
Journey section shows tech + social running together:

- Personal reflection on meaning (service, not achievement)
- Closing note: "Real reward is seeing families get help"

## Tone Validation Examples

### ✅ Correct Singapore Humility Framing

**Example 1 - PSS Description**:
> "During COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, 8 ordinary Singaporeans saw families struggling and decided to help. We didn't have nonprofit experience or fancy credentials. We had time, some technical skills to build systems, and a belief that Singaporeans would help if we made it easy."

**Why it works**:
- "Ordinary Singaporeans" positioning
- Acknowledgment of limitations ("didn't have nonprofit experience")
- Collective "we" language
- Humble deflection

**Example 2 - Team Credits for PSS**:
> "Every number here represents collective effort. The 8 founders handled operations, but 73 volunteers made deliveries happen. Hundreds of donors trusted strangers during crisis. My family supported me working on this during Circuit Breaker when others were spending time with families. My PayPal colleagues made sure I had the time to serve."

**Why it works**:
- Specific acknowledgment of each contributor group
- Family sacrifice mentioned
- Colleague support recognized
- "Time to serve" (not "my achievement")

**Example 3 - TikTok Leadership**:
> "At TikTok, I work with talented teams building distributed systems that serve millions. As Site Leader for Server Architecture and Engineering Leader for Operational Support and Efficiency (OSE), I'm privileged to work alongside engineers solving complex problems in infrastructure reliability and operational excellence."

**Why it works**:
- "Work with" (not "lead")
- "Privileged to work alongside" (not "I built")
- Team emphasis before personal role
- No individual heroics

### ❌ Avoided American Personal Branding

**What was AVOIDED**:
- ❌ "Award-winning tech leader and social entrepreneur"
- ❌ "I founded and scaled Project Stable Staples to raise SGD 160k"
- ❌ "Leading critical infrastructure at TikTok serving millions globally"
- ❌ Standalone awards showcase section
- ❌ "Leveraging technical expertise to drive social impact at scale"

**Why these were avoided**:
- Too much individual credit
- Silicon Valley self-promotion style
- Credentials before mission
- Awards as personal achievement
- Corporate jargon without humanity
