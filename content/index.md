An engineering leader with a passion for solving social problems, I get in the weeds to handle all kinds of problems.

I'm currently a Site Leader for the Server Architecture org in TikTok, and run the eSRE function in TikTok Singapore. 

In my time outside of work, I do both on the ground work to support communities at risk ([IAmTalentedSG](https://iamtalented.sg/), Project Stable Staples[closed]), as well as philanthropic work ([Lai Yu Hua Bursary](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/financial-support/lai-yu-hua-bursary/)) that sees me taking an active approach in working with the recipients of the support.

## Social

I am passionate about social empowerment and have dedicated my time to uplifting youths in at-risk communities. From 2014 to 2024, I contributed to IAmTalentedSG, improving operational efficiency with technology while also serving as the event photographer.

During the COVID-19 crisis, I co-founded Project Stable Staples, raising over SGD 160,000 to support 600 families in rental communities. Our efforts were recognized with the NVPC PVPA People of Good award by President Halimah Yacob. Even after the pandemic, I continued running the initiative with a small volunteer team, ensuring families in transition had a rapid support system until existing social infrastructure could take over.

Now, as I transition into philanthropic work, I am eager to take on my next challenge and continue making a meaningful impact.

## Engineering

I have had a diverse experience across software engineering, from data center management to mobile application development.

Currently, I've taken on the role of an engineering leader, but I've also demonstrated the competency to get my hands dirty when the need arises. I focus more on people management professionally these days, while keeping my technical skills updated through personal side projects, be it for my own work, or for the social initiatives I participate in.
