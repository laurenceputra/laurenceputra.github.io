  heading: "What I'm working on"
  subheading: "When we care together, we can achieve more together"
  mission_statement: |
    The work I'm privileged to be part of centers on a simple belief: ordinary Singaporeans can do extraordinary things when we look out for someone we don't know. This isn't about individual achievement—it's about what communities can build together when we decide to care beyond our own circles.

        LYHKYLF provides funding for social initiatives that traditional philanthropy won't support—experimental ideas, first-time organisers, and projects that need early belief before they have proven results.
        
        Named after my late father, Lai Yu Hua, the fund honors his belief that education is a key driver of social mobility; it supports initiatives that help uplift future generations and expand opportunity.

  introduction: |
    Recognition and awards are humbling, but they're never about one person. Every project mentioned here represents the work of many—volunteers who gave their time, donors who gave their resources, communities who gave their trust, and collaborators who gave their expertise.
  
  projects:
    - name: "Project Stable Staples"
      period: "2020-Present"
      description: |
        During COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, 8 ordinary Singaporeans saw families struggling and decided to help. We didn't have nonprofit experience or fancy credentials. We had time, some technical skills to build systems, and a belief that Singaporeans would help if we made it easy.
      
      impact:
        - ">SGD 160,000 raised from public donations"
        - ">2,600 individuals and families supported"
        - "73 volunteers coordinated logistics, packed supplies, delivered aid"
      
      team_credits: |
        Every number here represents collective effort. The 8 founders handled operations, but 73 volunteers made deliveries happen. Hundreds of donors trusted strangers during crisis. My family supported me working on this during Circuit Breaker when others were spending time with families. My PayPal colleagues made sure I had the time to serve.
      
      recognition:
        award: "People of Good Award 2020"
        context: "President's Volunteerism & Philanthropy Awards"
        frame: "This award recognized the 73 volunteers who showed up every week, not any individual organizer. It belongs to all of us."
      
      quote: |
        "I'd like to thank the public for entrusting a bunch of ordinary Singaporeans with their money during these uncertain periods, believing it will go to the right places. And I'd like to thank the Project Stable Staples team for being an amazing team to run this with. All 73 volunteers played their part to make this work."

        For over 10 years, I've been privileged to be part of the IAmTalented.SG core team. IAT reaches Secondary 2 and 3 students with skills-based workshops—coding, design, photography, entrepreneurship—showing young people there are many paths beyond academic grades.
      
      impact:
        - "10+ years of sustained workshops"
        - "Hundreds of students exposed to non-academic pathways"
        - "Dozens of volunteer facilitators each year"
      
      team_credits: |
        IAT's impact comes entirely from volunteers who give up weekends to run workshops, industry professionals who share their skills, and educators who trust us with their students. I'm one contributor among many who believe in expanding what success can look like.
      
      philosophy: |
        Singapore's education system is highly structured. IAT exists because many of us wish someone had shown us alternative paths earlier. We're paying it forward.

        As lead organizer (2012-2014), I worked with an organizing committee to grow GeekcampSG from 200 to 1,300+ attendees. The conference became a place where students—often a third of attendees—could learn from industry professionals in an accessible, non-commercial setting.
      
      impact:
        - "Grew from 200 to 1,300+ attendees"
        - "~33% student participation"
        - "Free, community-driven tech conference"
      
      team_credits: |
        Every year's success came from the organizing committee who handled logistics, speakers who shared knowledge for free, sponsors who believed in community learning, and attendees who created the welcoming atmosphere. My role was coordination; the conference belonged to the community.

        At PayPal Singapore, I had the privilege of building a developer community program from a team of 2 to over 20 PayPal engineers hosting up to 12 meetups per month. We opened our office to the community, hosted talks, and created space for developers to learn together.
      
      impact:
        - "12 meetups per month at peak"
        - "20+ PayPal engineers volunteering as hosts/speakers"
        - "Hundreds of community developers engaged"
      
      team_credits: |
        This program succeeded because PayPal engineers gave their time after work hours, facility teams made our office welcoming, and leadership supported community engagement as part of our mission. Individual meetup organizers in Singapore's tech community trusted us to host their events. It was collective effort.

    "Look out for someone we don't know"—that's the spirit that drives this work. If you're doing the same, let's support each other.

## Building Communities, Supporting People

For over a decade, I've been privileged to work at the intersection of technology and community—building distributed systems professionally while building communities of care personally. These paths have always run parallel, each informing the other.

The technical work is fascinating: distributed systems, infrastructure reliability, security at scale. But what gives it meaning is creating environments where teams thrive and using those skills to serve people who need support.

This site documents that journey—not as individual achievement, but as collective effort. Every project here represents the work of many: volunteers, donors, collaborators, and communities who trusted ordinary Singaporeans to do good work together.

### The Constant Thread

Whether organizing GeekcampSG with fellow volunteers, building Project Stable Staples with 73 volunteers during COVID-19, or leading engineering teams at TikTok—the constant has been showing up for people and believing in what communities can achieve together.

"Jiak ba bo tai ji zuo" (eat full nothing to do) is how I describe it, but really: with privilege comes responsibility to serve. I've been privileged with education, stable employment, technical skills, and supportive communities. The least I can do is pass that forward.

### Mission-First

The work centers on a simple belief: when we care together, we can achieve more together. That means:

- **In tech leadership**: Creating space for teams to do their best work, learn together, and build systems that serve millions
- **In social work**: Supporting initiatives that traditional funding won't reach, trusting young changemakers before they have proven results
- **In community building**: Showing up consistently, giving credit generously, and believing ordinary Singaporeans can do extraordinary things

This isn't about being a hero. It's about being one person in a long chain of people who care—learning from those who came before, serving those who need support now, and hopefully inspiring others to join in.

### What's Here

This site documents:
- **Current work** at TikTok and with LYHKYLF
- **The journey** of parallel paths in tech and community over 10+ years
- **Impact** created by many hands working together
- **Recognition** that belongs to entire teams and communities
- **Ways to connect** if you're on a similar path

Every story here emphasizes team credits because that's the truth: none of this was solo work. The awards mentioned recognize collective achievement. The impact numbers represent what communities accomplished together.

### The Spirit

Singapore has a beautiful tradition of quietly doing good work without fanfare. "Don't need to talk big, just do"—that's the culture. This site exists not for self-promotion, but as a record of what ordinary Singaporeans can achieve when we look out for someone we don't know.

If you're building communities, supporting people, or trying to use your skills to serve—you're already part of this story. Let's keep going together.
