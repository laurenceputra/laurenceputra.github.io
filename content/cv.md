An engineering manager with a strong engineering and operations background, I have been on both sides of the dev and ops worlds both as an engineer and as a manager. I’m a versatile engineer with a knack for picking up new technologies on the fly. I am currently in my second official role as an engineering manager, and believe in growing resilient teams. I have worked on, and led teams across huge variety of technologies, from mobile to web to servers. It is my core belief that strong fundamentals allow anyone to pick up new technologies rapidly.
