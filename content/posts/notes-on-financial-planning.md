As with most things, when one comes up with a plan, in order for the plan to flow, there must be some undeniable principles that are first established which will guide the plan later on. Please do note that this is really a documentation of my thought process, and does not constitute as financial advice for anyone.

## Principles

  1. Always have emergency funds in cash, or cash like vehicles
     * The amount can be up to an individual, but it is important to have that amount defined in one's head
  2. Plan for upcoming major expenses, if an upcoming expense requires a loan, evaluate if your existing investment vehicles are able to generate the income to support the loan
     * If the existing investment vehicles are unable to generate the income to support the loan, maybe it will be good to re-evaluate if the expense is needed
     * For example, first house, maybe yes, especially if your income is able to support it comfortably. 2nd house, or 2nd car, maybe not. 1st car? I wouldn't do it, but it's up to the individual
  3. Any money that is expected to be needed after the within the next 5 years aside for emergency funds is a good candidate for a pool of of income producing vehicles, like bonds or low volatility income funds.
  4. Any money that is not expected to be needed in the next 5 years is a good candidate for a diversified high risk investment portfolio
     * Your risk appetite might tell you otherwise, and that is perfectly fine.
     * You could go for a diversified medium - low risk investment portfolio as well.

## Investment Vehicles/Levers

Numbers here are accurate as of 3rd Sept 2021. Please do your own research on updated numbers.

  * Cash like vehicles
    * The nature of these vehicles is that it is unlikely to fall too much, and have a historical track record of not having bad periods that last more than a month.
    * Examples of these include money market funds, which at the point of this post generates around 0.64% returns annually that is given to you daily.
    * This is still higher than most of the bank accounts' interest rates, with the exception of the high yield savings accounts, which often has a cap, and requires you to jump through hoops.
    * Personal strategy: Max out high yield savings account, and park any emergency funds above it in a money market fund
    * Note: It may take up to 1 week to withdraw from these funds
    * Examples of cashlike vehicles
      * LionGlobal SGD Money Market SGD (~0.64%): Available on OCBC unit trusts under internet banking, or [fundsupermart](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/funds/factsheet/370209)
      * LionGlobal SGD Enhanced Liquidity A Acc SGD (~1.04%): available on [fundsupermart](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/funds/factsheet/LCP129/).
      * Endowus Cash Smart: Transparent projected returns that are updated regularly and calculated after taking into account fees, 3 tiers of risks, from super stable and unlikely to ever fall, to a 1 month recovery window, and the highest risk of 3 months recovery window. Projected returns range from 0.7% to 2.1%
  * Bond and low volatility income funds
    * Nature of these vehicles is that they generate income through dividends, tend to follow the general direction of stocks, but are generally less volatile than stocks, although there are exceptions to the rule.
    * Income will still be generated during periods of poor performance, although it might decrease as well.
    * Examples of vehicles in this category
      * Allianz Income and Growth Cl AM DIS H2-SGD (~7%): Available on OCBC unit trusts, or [fundsupermart](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/funds/factsheet/ALZ210/). Fell around < 16% from Jan 2020 to March 2020, but recovered soon after. To put it in perspective, the stock market fell slightly more than 16% in this period, and recovered as well.
      * Blackrock Dynamic High Income A6 SGD-H (~6.5%): Available on OCBC unit trusts, or fundsupermart. Fell around 21% from Jan 2020 to March 2020, but recovered soon after.
  * Higher risk Investments
    * Nature of these vehicles is that they attempt to beat the index, with the exception of funds that tries to replicate the index.
    * One could be potentially looking at higher
