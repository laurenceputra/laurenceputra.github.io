I'm honoured to have been considered for the NUS Outstanding Young Alumni Award, and even more humbled to have received it. As someone who recently turned 30, I'm amused to still be called 'young' in some circles.

Jokes aside, this award is a tribute to the community around me, the people who helped me grow into who I am today.

I'm grateful to my family for supporting my work outside my core responsibilities, from Geekcamp.SG when I was studying, to I Am Talented (IAT) earlier in my career, and most recently Project Stable Staples during Circuit Breaker. Without their support, I couldn't have done what I have.

I am thankful to Michael Cheng early on for his guidance when I started organising tech events as a student and ran the largest tech conference in Singapore in a time before Smart Nation. I'm also extremely appreciative of Chang Sau Sheong and Colin Leong for being supportive of my efforts to give back to the tech community during my first stint at PayPal. I still believe my first stint at PayPal laid the foundation for who I am.

I'm deeply grateful to the team at I Am Talented (IAT) for absorbing a new face into their team in 2013, and through IATsg, I found a new side of me I never thought existed. I used to be that kid who was extremely reluctant to go to CIP events, but something just clicked serving with this team. David Hoe, Melvin Tay, Kindred Maurice, Nurfadhilla Kamarul, Qamar Firdaus Saini, Peiying, it has been amazing so far, and I look forward to continuing to serve the community alongside all of you in the years ahead.

Of course, a mention of my tech life and IAT would not be complete without a mention of Michelle Lye. She has been extremely supportive of my endeavours so far, from giving talks at GeekcampSG to running tech workshops at IATsg that students just want to keep returning to. Michelle and her AIS Cube team have always been there to make whatever I run a success, and I'd like to thank her for having my back.

During Circuit Breaker I had the chance to start Project Stable Staples with like-minded peers. PSS later moved to a smaller, more sustainable model, but the lessons from those early days stayed with me. Thank you to Gillian, Kelvin and Jesslyn for handling logistics and beneficiary communications, and for being a sounding board on hard days. I'm also grateful to friends and colleagues who supported our vision for sustainable giving, joined our sponsor bench, and trusted us to direct funds where they were needed most. A special thanks to PayPal for the award funds that helped us and for nominating me for the President's award.

I'm also thankful to folks I've met in National University of Singapore who have been supportive of the work I've done so far. Miran Ng for being a sounding board when I need one and for listening to all the nonsense I come up with. Prof Gary, Adele and John from SoC have provided me with ample opportunities to give back to my alma mater, and in the process make my employers think that I'm better than I really am 😅. Tembusu College for also having a mentoring programme, and giving me a dinner buddy to catch up with today (but seriously, Tembusu College has honed my critical thinking skills quite a bit). Thank you all for standing by me through all these years.

Lastly, in my entire career in tech so far, the one constant who has always been there is Bernard. From being my first boss at my first internship till now, he has always been there for me, especially when I needed advice. He has also been one of my loudest advocates, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Bernard for being there for me all these years.

It is clear by this point that my achievements are not mine alone. They are the result of many people coming together to lift this young punk (yes I'm going to keep calling myself young while I still can). This award is also not an end to the journey, but rather a challenge. Many of my fellow award winners have undoubtedly achieved much more than I have, and I now have much to do to live up to this award.

I look forward to continuing serving the community, alongside all of you :)
