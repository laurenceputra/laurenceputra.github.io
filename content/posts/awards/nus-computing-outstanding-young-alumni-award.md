It was an honor to be invited back to [NUS Computing](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuscomputing/) to celebrate the opening of the new Computing building and to receive the Outstanding Computing Young Alumni award. I'm still grateful to be considered 'young'.  
As with my other awards, this recognition is not just about me. I've been lucky to have a strong ecosystem of supporters, and this award is for all of you who have walked alongside me over the past decade. I look forward to continuing to work with many of you.
