I never imagined I'd see my face on display across the heartlands, but Project Lionheart has included David Hoe's and my story with Project Stable Staples and iatSG in their touring exhibition. The work we do depends on many people, including volunteers, partners, and neighbours, who contribute in small but meaningful ways. As we move beyond the pandemic, let's continue to look out for one another and support those who need help.

Thanks to [Project Lionheart](https://projectlionheart.sg/stories/) for featuring our story.

We will look out for someone we don't know. Will you?
