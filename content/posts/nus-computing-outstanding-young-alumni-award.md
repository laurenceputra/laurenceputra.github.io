> Was an honor to have been invited back to [NUS Computing](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuscomputing/) to celebrate the opening of the new Computing building, and to receive the Outstanding Computing Young Alumni award. At this stage in my life, I'm still extremely thankful that I am considered young.  
>   
> As with the other awards I've gotten, it was never just recognition of me. I've been extremely lucky to have had a strong ecosystem of supporters, and it is with the support of all of these people that I'm able to do the stuff that I do. This award is for all of you who've walked alongside and supported me through the past decade, and I look forward to continuing to work with many of you to continue down the various paths that we are on.
