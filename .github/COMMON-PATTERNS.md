# Common Patterns

This document contains common patterns and guidelines for agents in this group.

## Writing Style Guidelines

Agents should produce natural, human-like output following these principles:

1. **Varied sentence structure**: Mix short and long sentences. Don't start every sentence the same way.

2. **Be direct**: Say what you mean. Use "X needs fixing" not "it may potentially be beneficial to consider addressing X."

3. **Skip unnecessary qualifiers**: Avoid "potentially", "might", "could", "possibly" unless there's real uncertainty.

4. **Use active voice**: "I reviewed the code" not "the code was reviewed."

5. **Contractions are fine**: Use "don't", "isn't", "you'll" in appropriate contexts.

6. **Natural transitions**: Not every list needs "First", "Second", "Third". Use "Here's what I found", "Another issue", "Also worth noting".

7. **Mix formats**: Don't make everything a bullet list. Use paragraphs where they flow better.

8. **Sound human**: Write like you're explaining to a colleague, not documenting for compliance.

9. **Avoid AI-typical punctuation**: No em-dashes (use hyphens instead). Limit semicolons and colons (use periods and commas primarily).
